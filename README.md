# Intro-To-NET-CrashCourse

This is the repository where the "hands on" portion of the "What/Why/How to .NET" crash course will live. The main branch will contain the Instructions (the README) and any other default code examples that are needed (if any). There is a branch called "Final". That is the complete example of what we are going to build


### Pre Reqs

Please have the following downloaded and installed before the creash course. This is not hard just time consuming (~30-60 mins) for everything to download and install. 

- Have Windows 10 installed on your computer
  - If you are on a Mac, then you have 2 options, partition your hard drive or set up a virtual machine (vm).
  - To set up a partition, look here ( https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204990 )
  - To set up Windows 10 in a vm ( http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/run-windows-10-on-your-mac-using-virtualbox-3621650 )
- Have Visual Studio Community downloaded and install
  - We will be using the Community edition ( https://www.visualstudio.com/post-download-vs/?sku=community&clcid=0x409&downloadrename=true )
